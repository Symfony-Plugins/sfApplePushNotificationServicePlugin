= sfApplePushNotificationServicePlugin plugin =

The `sfApplePushNotificationServicePlugin` it's the perfect plugin to manage Apple push notifications from you symfony app to the iphone users all around the globe. 
It counts with a queue listener supporting:
 - Activemq (sfActivemqPlugin required)
 - More of them will be added soon...

== Installation ==

To install the plugin for a symfony project, the usual process is to use the
symfony command line.

With symfony 1.0, use:

{{{
$ symfony plugin-install http://plugins.symfony-project.com/sfApplePushNotificationServicePlugin
}}}

With symfony 1.1/1.2, use:

{{{
$ symfony plugin:install sfApplePushNotificationServicePlugin
}}}

Clear the cache to enable the autoloading to find the new classes:
{{{
$ php symfony cc
}}}

You're done.

Special thanks: Fabien POTENCIER - I will be creating my own readme soon adding information about the usage of the plugin.
